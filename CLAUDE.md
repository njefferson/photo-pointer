# Standing rules for Claude sessions on this repo

Read `LESSONS.md` (the conventions contract derived from the sibling repos)
and `NOTES.md` (source of truth: thesis, roadmap, settled decisions) before
doing anything.

## 0. NEVER use the AskUserQuestion / choice-popup tool (Noah, 2026-07-17,
## absolute and permanent, applies to every repo). Present choices as plain
## text; he replies in his own words.

## Branches: only `staging` and `main`, ever (Noah, 2026-07-19). No `claude/*`,
## no other branches, and NO pull requests — he does not use them. EVERY build
## lands on `staging`; his hands-on device test happens there; he EXPLICITLY
## says "promote to main" and only then does it go to `main` (= production
## deploy). Never promote to main on your own read of "it's ready." Docs-only
## changes may go straight to main. Start every session by checking whether
## `staging` is ahead of `main` — that candidate is already waiting on his
## test; surface it, never rebuild it (it's also logged in Project facts).

## Accessibility is a top priority (owner mandate). Hue-only encoding is a
## fail state. Every new visual encoding states its non-hue channel at design
## time; `node scripts/check-contrast.mjs` is a gate (add new fg/bg pairs in
## the same commit); keyboard + focus-visible always.

## License: PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 (LICENSE.md), same as Clear Horizons
## (Noah, 2026-07-19 — corrected from an earlier wrong "no LICENSE" reading).
## Keep the header scope current when third-party material changes.

## Licensing is load-bearing. Every ingest adapter declares its source's
## license in its header and honors it structurally (HMdb: links only;
## Flickr: CC/PD only; eBird: no bulk redistribution). Never add a source
## without reading its terms first. NO Instagram, NO social-platform
## scraping — settled at project creation, do not re-offer.

## Verify before delegating / claiming. Sandbox egress blocks Overpass and
## most APIs (probe first: `node ingest/ingest.mjs probe`); ingest runs on
## Actions runners via workflow dispatch (MCP actions_run_trigger is the
## proven channel). State what was VERIFIED (headless, request inspection)
## vs what NEEDS NOAH'S HANDS (real iPad/iPhone feel).

## The owner is iPad-first, often driving: one step at a time, no
## desktop-required steps unless every alternative is exhausted, finished
## work only. Commit messages and changelogs are written for the END USER.

## Repo metadata (description, website, topics, social preview) is a manual
## GitHub-UI step the session token cannot perform. Canonical values:
## - Description: `One map of every photo-worthy place in your region — viewpoints, markers, oddities, parks, trails, wildlife, dark skies. Open data only.`
## - Website: `https://photo-pointer.pages.dev`
## - Topics: `photography` `maps` `openstreetmap` `pwa` `offline-first` `poi`
## List these and ask Noah to confirm each is done; never report the repo
## "set up" while any is unconfirmed.

## Project facts (append on every release, unprompted)
- 2026-07-19 SCAFFOLDED (this repo's genesis): Spot schema + dedup
  (src/model/), OSM/Overpass adapter working + 6 stub adapters with license
  notes (ingest/adapters/), region config seeded Sacramento/El Dorado/Placer
  (config/region.json), Leaflet map app (no build step), sw.js offline,
  contrast gate, 33 node --test tests, CI/deploy/ingest workflows.
- 2026-07-19 0.3.0 "Cross-layer synthesis" BUILT on staging (awaiting on-device
  pass): the app's DIFFERENTIATOR. Competitive research (real, this session)
  showed every layer is already served better by a dedicated app — the only
  unmet need is scoring spots where MULTIPLE layers line up. src/model/
  synthesis.js is a SIGNAL REGISTRY: new data source = append one signal
  {key,label,weight,evaluate(spot,ctx)->{value,note}|null}; scoreSpot NEVER
  changes. Score = Σ(value·weight)/(Σ weights of LIVE signals) so breadth wins
  and dormant sources don't suppress scores. darkSky signal ships DORMANT →
  auto-activates when a source writes tags.bortle (tested). UI: ★ Top spots
  panel (ui/synthesis.js — rank + require-layer chips + fly-to via
  mapview.focusSpot) + "Why this spot" popup breakdown. sw CACHE pointer-0.3.0.
  Verified headless: top spot "Upper Eagle Falls" 65 (layered+wildlife+view),
  require Dark-sky→empty (dormant proof), 3-layer require→3 spots all matching,
  52 tests, contrast green, zero pageerrors. See the synthesis contract in
  NOTES.md — don't edit scoreSpot to add a source.
- 2026-07-19 0.1.0 PROMOTED to main (Noah's "Promote to main"): production
  live at photo-pointer.pages.dev (Deploy run on main green). Then eBird added
  (2,362 spots) + PolyForm license. main == 0.1.0.
- 2026-07-19 0.2.0 "Golden Hour" BUILT on staging (awaiting on-device pass):
  per-spot "Light today" in the popup — blue/golden-hour, sunrise, sunset +
  sun COMPASS direction, computed on-device (src/model/light.js) via vendored
  astronomy-engine (MIT, src/vendor/astronomy.js). GOTCHA baked into light.js:
  anchor the rise/set search at the spot's LOCAL midnight (est. from lng,
  solar time = UTC + lng/15h) — a UTC-midnight anchor returns YESTERDAY's
  sunset for US sites. sw CACHE pointer-0.2.0 (astronomy.js + light.js
  precached). Verified headless (TZ=America/Los_Angeles): popup shows
  "Sunrise 5:54 AM NE", 6 windows ordered, polar day handled, zero pageerrors;
  43 tests, contrast green.
- 2026-07-19 FIRST LIVE DATA: Ingest OSM committed data/spots.json = 1,711
  deduped spots for Sacramento/El Dorado/Placer (OSM/Overpass, ODbL). Deploy
  auto-creates the Pages project; staging deploys are green (no secrets step
  needed — they're inherited from Noah's account). GOTCHAS learned this
  session: (1) Overpass rejects anonymous UAs (406/429) — send a real
  User-Agent; (2) Overpass public mirrors hang/504 under load — retry across
  3 mirrors with a 210s per-attempt cap + a 25-min job timeout; (3) the
  dedup_key can collide for two DIFFERENT nearby places sharing a geohash
  cell — resolveSpots suffixes collisions (`~2`) so ids stay unique.
